# ToDo Project

## This project is a Rocketseat challenge on the ReactJS trail, they make the project prototype available and give us the freedom to practice what we learned on the trail.

The 'ToDo' has task creation functionality, allowing people to organize their tasks and mark them as completed, giving them control of what has to be done in their day to day or work.
